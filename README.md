## Content of workshops

### Introduction to Data Analytics

The series of three seminars is designed to help you to quickly start using R as a tool for data analytics, vizualization and basic statistics. We start almost immediately with tidyverse as it is much easier to learn and more practical for beginners than base R.

#### Part 1

* Introduction into R & RStudio
* Sources for learning and/or help
* Syntax and data strctures
* Basic data imports (RData, csv)
* Functional programming (purrr)
* Basic data manipulation (dplyr)
* Basic vizualization (ggplot2)

#### Part 2

* Data imports (Excel, SQL, ...)
* Aggregation of grouped data (dplyr)
* Advanced data manipulation (dplyr, tidyr)
* Operation with text (stringr, tidyr)
* Advanced data vizualization with focus on grouped data (ggplot2)

#### Part 3

* Wrapping-up load-transform-vizualize process
* Automatization of analyses and reports (RMarkdown)
* Statistics & Machine Learning (stats, randomForrest, nnet, Keras, ...)
* Web scraping (rvest)
